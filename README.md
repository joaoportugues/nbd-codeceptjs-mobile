from root folder of the project (--steps --features --debug --verbose are available for different levels of logging):
```sh
npx codeceptjs run
```
or
```sh
npx codeceptjs run --debug
```
Use different configs with -c (supports browserStack)
```sh
npx codeceptjs run -c codecept.config-browserStack.js
```

and to get the testing reports
```sh
allure serve reports/2020-8-4 (or any other folder available)
```

You can use tags as well:
```sh
npx codeceptjs run --grep "@runThis"
```

## Detailed project creation and helper tools

```sh
mkdir your_dir_name
cd your_dir_name
```

```sh
